## Predicting-the-percentage-of-students
Step-1:Install the required librares such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html),[numpy](https://numpy.org/install/),[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) amd [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

Step-2:First I took the dataset in .csv format and loaded the data into jupyter notebook using pandas dataframe.

Step-3:Then printed the first 5 rows of the dataset.After that I displayed the dataset using scatter plot present in matplotlib.

Step-4:Took all independent variables(in this case only 1 independent variable(Hours)) in one new dataset and Scores as dependent variable.

Step-5:Used linear model present in sklearn library to fit the dataset and predicted the required information using the trained model.

Step-6:Finally displaying the line of regression which is best fitted for the given dataset.
